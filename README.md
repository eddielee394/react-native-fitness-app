##Setup

- clone repo
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`

*This project requires a `.env` file to run on development environments.  This file is automatically generated for you when running `npm start` for the first time.  DO NOT CHECK-IN YOUR .ENV FILE TO VERSION CONTROL.  This is strictly for local development variables. Available variables can be found in `.env.example` & if new variables are added, those should be also added to `.env.example` as well.
